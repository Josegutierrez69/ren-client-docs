The RenVM Tracker is a server that syncs RenVM blocks and tracks volume, locked amounts and historic asset prices.

### Usage

The interface is a GraphQL endpoint running at https://renvm-tracker.herokuapp.com (mainnet) and https://renvm-tracker-testnet.herokuapp.com (testnet).

There is one type of queryable entities, `Snapshots`, which contain RenVM's statistics for a specific timestamp.

Snapshots can be queried by providing a Unix timestamp in seconds. The request will return the most recent `Snapshot` before or at that timestamp. If the timestamp is from before the first `Snapshot`, an error will be thrown.

The volume in a `Snapshot` is the total since the network came online, so to get the volume of a specific period (e.g. 1 month), you should get the snapshots from the start and the end of the period and subtract the volume and locked amounts.

You can request multiple snapshots in a single request by using labels (see the label `snapshot1` below).

The `fees` field is only available for snapshots from August 2021 onwards.

```graphql
{
  snapshot1: Snapshot(timestamp: "1627300267") {
    id
    timestamp
    locked {
      asset
      chain
      amount
      amountInUsd
    }
    volume {
      asset
      chain
      amount
      amountInUsd
    }
    # Only available for Snapshots from August 2021 onwards.
    fees {
      asset
      amount
      amountInUsd
    }
    prices {
      asset
      decimals
      priceInUsd
    }
  }
}
```

In order to query the RenVM tracker, you will need a GraphQL library. Some options are:

1. The playground below
2. An SDK such as [Apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client) - see others at https://graphql.org/code/.
3. A desktop client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) or Postman
