title: Client Spec (WIP)
---

This document outlines all of a client's steps involved in initiating, submitting and completing mints and burns.

It serves as a specification for RenJS to follow, as well as for other potential client implementations.

# Locking

## Generating a gateway address

### Dependency chain

- Gateway address depends on
  - gPubKey, which depends on
    - the selector
    - the latest `ren_queryState` result
  - gHash, which depends on
    - the recipient
    - nonce
    - pHash, which depends on
      - payload
    - sHash, which depends on
      - the selector

### Information provided by the user / the front-end

1. The chain on which an asset is being locked
2. The asset being locked
3. The host chain, where the ren-asset will be minted
4. A recipient on the target chain - either a user's address or a contract
5. A payload associated with the recipient, such as the parameters for a contract call
6. A nonce, an arbitrary 32-byte integer

The **_selector_** is defined to be `ASSET/toHostChain` for the provided asset and host-chain.

> **Example**
>
> - **Lock-chain**: Terra
> - **Asset**: LUNA
> - **Host-chain**: Ethereum
> - **Selector**: `LUNA/toEthereum
> - **Recipient**: The `BasicAdapter` contract deployed at `0x32666B64e9fD0F44916E1378Efb2CFa3B3B96e80`, decoded from hex
> - **Payload**:
> - **Nonce**: 3

### Select a shard

A RenVM shard is selected using the `ren_queryState` JSON-RPC endpoint on RenVM. The shard must support the asset being locked.

We assign the shard's public key to the variable `gPubKey`.

> **Example**
>
> - `ren_queryState` result:
>
> ```
> POST https://rpc-testnet.renproject.io/
> {
> 	"id": 1,
> 	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
> 	"method": "ren_queryState",
> 	"params": {}
> }
> RESPONSE
> {
>   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
>   "id": 1,
>   "result": {
>     "state": {
>       "Bitcoin": {
>         "address": "mytu3FGw8cTzGTBTQZoVcZ2CZaYpRdk2YA",
>         "dust": "546",
>         "gasCap": "2",
>         "gasLimit": "400",
>         "gasPrice": "2",
>         "latestChainHash": "",
>         "latestChainHeight": "2034624",
>         "minimumAmount": "547",
>         "output": {

>             "index": "2"
>           },
>           "pubKeyScript": "dqkUyZiyqIrJZnbhTwdzkANBl5mmgjqIrA",
>           "value": "840258866"
>         },
>         "pubKey": "Aw3WX32ykguyKZEuP0IT3RUOX5csm3PpvnFNhEVhrDVc"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> We select the `pubKey` listed under `"Bitcoin"`.
>
> - **gPubKey**: `Aw3WX32ykguyKZEuP0IT3RUOX5csm3PpvnFNhEVhrDVc`

### Hashes

There are several hashes involved in generating a gateway address. All of them use Keccak256, but some encode the data being hashed differently.

The hashes are:

- **_sHash_** - the selector hash. `keccak256(selector)`
- **_pHash_** - the payload hash. `keccak256(payload)`
- **_gHash_** - the gateway hash. `keccak256(concat(pHash, sHash, recipient, nonce))`

> **_Example_**
>
> - **sHash**: `keccak256("LUNA/toEthereum")` => `cf82f7a141f97d439a22da6e28ef6c74c814875a32d79c6630afe73242e47e0d`
> - **pHash**: `keccak256()`
