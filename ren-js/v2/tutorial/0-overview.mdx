:::caution RenJS v3 Tutorial

This tutorial is for RenJS v2 - for the latest docs, please see [RenJS v3 Tutorial](../../v3/tutorial).

:::

This tutorial will walk you through writing a basic front-end app that uses RenVM to mint BTC to an Ethereum smart contract. It is designed to be a quick introduction to RenVM and should be read together with the other examples, which provide more in-depth explanations.

You'll get started by writing and deploying a smart contract to Ethereum Kovan, and then you'll use RenJS to build a simple user interface that can communicate with the smart contract. You'll end up with a website that you can use to deposit/withdraw testnet BTC to/from Kovan Ethereum using RenVM.

It will look like this:

Continue to the next section to begin setting up the smart contract.
