This page goes over the `RenJS`, `Gateway` and `GatewayTransaction` classes.

### RenJS [(TypeDoc)](https://renproject.github.io/ren-js-v3-docs/classes/_renproject_ren.RenJS.html)

The `RenJS` class provides methods for creating and configuring gateways.

It's initialized by providing a network or a RenVM provider. Generally, your program or website should only have one RenJS instance per network.

```ts
import RenJS from "@renproject/ren";
import { RenNetwork } from "@renproject/utils";
import { RenVMProvider } from "@renproject/provider";
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "@renproject/provider/build/main/rpc/jsonRpc";

// Mainnet - the following are equivalent:
new RenJS();
new RenJS("mainnet");
new RenJS(RenNetwork.Mainnet);
new RenJS("https://rpc.renproject.io");
new RenJS(new RenVMProvider("mainnet"));
new RenJS(new RenVMProvider("https://rpc.renproject.io"));
new RenJS(new RenVMProvider(new JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.renproject.io")));

// Testnet
new RenJS("testnet");
```

The second parameter for `RenJS` allows you to pass in some additional configuration:

```ts
import RenJS from "@renproject/ren";
import { LogLevel } from "@renproject/ren";

new RenJS("mainnet", {
    // Configure a logger:
    logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
    logger: console,

    // Configure network delay for monitoring gateway addresses:
    networkDelay: 15000, // 15 seconds
});
```

Before creating a gateway or fetching fees, you'll need to connect the chain classes to RenJS:

```ts
import RenJS from "@renproject/ren";
import { Bitcoin, Ethereum } from "@renproject/chains";

const bitcoin = new Bitcoin({ network: "testnet" });
const ethereum = new Ethereum({ network: "testnet", signer: ... });

const renJS = new RenJS("testnet")
    .withChains(bitcoin, ethereum);

// Equivalently:
renJS.withChains([bitcoin, ethereum]);
renJS.withChain(bitcoin).withChain(ethereum);
```

You can now use the various fields and methods available on RenJS:

-   `renJS.provider` - return the provider being used
-   `renJS.getChain` - for getting the chain instances added with `withChains`
-   `renJS.getFees` - for estimating gateway fees
-   `renJS.gateway` - for creating Gateways
-   `renJS.gatewayTransaction` - for re-creating Gateway Transactions created by a Gateway
-   `renJS.selectShard` - for fetching an asset's associated RenVM shard (currently there's only one shard)
-   `RenJS.defaultTransactionHandler` - a static method that you can pass to a `gateway.on("transaction")

---

### Gateway [(TypeDoc)](https://renproject.github.io/ren-js-v3-docs/classes/_renproject_ren.Gateway.html)

`renJS.gateway` is used to initialize `Gateway` instances. The parameters are as follows:

```ts
interface GatewayParams<
    FromPayload extends { chain: string },
    ToPayload extends { chain: string }
> {
    /* Required */

    // The asset being minted or burned - e.g. "BTC".
    asset: string;

    // The payload provided by the from-chain.
    from: FromPayload;

    // The payload provided by the to-chain.
    to: ToPayload;

    /* Optional */

    // See section on nonces. A URL-base64 string or a number.
    nonce?: string | number;

    // Provide a specific RenVM shard - this will come in handy when RenVM shards rotate daily.
    shard?: RenVMShard;

    // A tag for tracking the volume of a particular bridge (still being implemented)
    tag?: string;
}
```

After creating the gateway, any missing parameters are filled in and available from `gateway.params`. If you are persisting the gateway details, then you should save `gateway.params` instead of the parameters being passed into `renJS.gateway`. `gateway.params` can be serialized and deserialized using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`:

```ts
// User creates new gateway
const gateway = await renJS.gateway({...});
const paramsToSave: string = JSON.stringify(gateway.params);

// User resumes gateway
gateway = await renJS.gateway(JSON.parse(paramsToSave));
```

There are several fields on a Gateway instance that may be useful:

-   `gateway.fromChain` and `gateway.toChain` allow you to access the chain instances that were passed into `renJS.withChains`
-   `gateway.provider` - the same provider as `renJS.provider`
-   `gateway.fees` - for calculating the expected fees
-   `gateway.gatewayAddress` - for deposit gateways
-   `gateway.inSetup` - transactions required before submitting the `in` transaction
-   `gateway.in` - for contract gateways, the input transaction submitter or waiter
-   `gateway.on` - for listening to `"transaction"` events
-   `gateway.eventEmitter` - the event emitter that `gateway.on` calls.
    -   `gateway.eventEmitter.once`
    -   `gateway.eventEmitter.removeListener`
    -   `gateway.eventEmitter.removeAllListeners`
    -   `gateway.eventEmitter.listenerCount`

`gateway.fees` will return a [`GatewayFees`](https://renproject.github.io/ren-js-v3-docs/interfaces/_renproject_ren.GatewayFees.html) object with the following fields:

```
interface GatewayFees {
    // The fixed part of the fee (the fixed-fee asset is currently not available on the fee object)
    fixedFee: BigNumber;

    // Variable fee - in BPS. (e.g. 15 BPS is 0.15%)
    variableFee: number;

    // The minimum intput amount that can be sent.
    minimumAmount: BigNumber;

    // Estimate how much will be minted/released by sending a certain amount.
    estimateOutput: (input: BigNumber) => BigNumber;
}
```
