### Introduction

**RenVM** is an open protocol for connecting together cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps across different blockchains.

**RenJS** is the official JavaScript and TypeScript library for integrating with RenVM, allowing developers to bridge cryptocurrencies between chains and build cross-chain applications.

:::note Example

_Moving an asset like BTC to Ethereum involves minting renBTC, an ERC20 token on Ethereum. When 1 BTC is locked on Bitcoin, 1 renBTC is minted on Ethereum which can be redeemed at any time for BTC again._

:::

### Installing

Start by installing RenJS using `npm` or `yarn`, along with the collection of modules for connecting to various chains:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @renproject/ren@next @renproject/chains@next
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --save @renproject/ren@next @renproject/chains@next
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can now import the RenJS library, as well the class for each chain supported by RenVM, and initialize them with the desired network:

```ts
// Import RenJS and chains.
import RenJS from "@renproject/ren";
import { Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana } from "@renproject/chains";

// Initialize each chain.
const bitcoin = new Bitcoin({ network: "testnet" });
const ethereum = new Ethereum({ network: "testnet", provider, signer });
const solana = new Solana({ network: "testnet", provider, signer });

// Initialize RenJS and pass in the initialized chains.
const renJS = new RenJS("testnet").withChains([bitcoin, ethereum, solana]);
```

### Gateways and gateway transactions

The main flow of interacting with RenJS is to first create a **gateway**, which contains all the required information for moving a specific asset between chains, including a recipient address or contract, and then move the asset through the gateway as one or more **gateway transactions**.

A gateway transaction is a collection of three sub-transactions on different chains:

1. The `in` input transaction will involve locking or burning funds on an origin chain.

2. The `renVM` transaction is submitted to the RenVM.

3. The `out` output transaction will mint or release funds on the target chain.

The `in` transaction will usually be submitted by the user, either as a deposit to an address or as a call to a smart contract. The `renVM` transaction will then result either in RenVM generating the `out` transaction, or generate a signature that can be submitted as part of the `out` transaction by the user or a third party.

RenVM will wait for the `in` transaction to reach the required number of confirmations before the `renVM` transaction can be processed.

:::note Example

_As an example, moving BTC from Bitcoin to Ethereum will involve:_

1. _A BTC deposit by the user to the gateway's associated **gateway address**._

2. _The RenVM transaction which will generate a signature._

3. _An Ethereum transaction by the user to submit the signature in order to **mint** renBTC._

_In order to return the BTC back to Bitcoin, the three transactions will be:_

1. _An Ethereum transaction by the user to burn the renBTC._

2. _The RenVM transaction to confirm the burn of the renBTC, which will then generate the third transaction:_

3. _A BTC transfer from RenVM's custody to the address specified by the user._

:::

Initializing a gateway involves specifying all of the details, including the asset and the origin and target chain:

```ts
// A gateway for moving BTC from Bitcoin to Ethereum.
const btcGateway = await renJS.gateway({
    asset: "BTC", // or bitcoin.assets.BTC,
    from: bitcoin.GatewayAddress(),
    to: ethereum.Account(),
});
```

```ts
// A gateway for moving DAI (originally from Ethereum) from the user's
// Binance Smart Chain account to a different address on Fantom.
const daiGateway = await renJS.gateway({
    asset: ethereum.assets.DAI,
    from: bsc.Account(),
    to: fantom.Address("0x123456..."),
});
```

Each chain has various ways of specifying where the assets should come from or where they should go - for example `bitcoin.GatewayAddress` and `bitcoin.Address`, `ethereum.Account` and `ethereum.Contract`, and so on. These are documented on the page for each chain.

After initializing the gateway, the next step will usually be to either display a gateway address, or, for web3 chains, to request the user to submit the `in` transaction through their browser-connected wallet (e.g. MetaMask for Ethereum, or Phantom for Solana):

```ts
// Print the gateway address
console.log(`\
    Deposit BTC to the following address: ${btcGateway.gatewayAddress}\
`);
```

```ts
// Submit the input transaction. This will prompt the user to sign
// a transaction, such as through MetaMask for Ethereum or other
// EVM chains.
daiGateway.in.submit();
```

:::tip

### Chain transactions

Each of the `in`, `renVM` and `out` transactions are all instances of the `TxWaiter` or `TxSubmitter` interfaces, which follows the format of separating the submitting and the waiting for confirmations into two methods. When a transaction is generated outside of RenJS, for example a BTC deposit to a gateway address, the transaction will only have a `.wait()` method which will only return once the transaction has sufficient confirmations. When a transaction is being created through RenJS, it will also have a `.submit()` method which will create and submit the transaction.

These interfaces can be found here: [TxWaiter](TxWaiter) and [TxSubmitter](TxSubmitter).

:::

The next step is to handle any deposits that are received at the gateway address, or any burn or lock events detected in the `in` transaction. Each deposit or event will create a new **gateway transaction**, described earlier.

```ts
gateway.on("transaction", (tx) => {
    // Wait for the `in` transaction to have enough confirmations.
    await tx.in.wait();

    // Submit the transaction to RenVM, and wait for it to be confirmed.
    await tx.renVM.submit();
    await tx.renVM.wait();

    // Check if the user needs to submit the output transaction - it may have
    // already been submitted by RenVM.
    if (tx.out.submit) {
        await tx.out.submit();
    }
    // Wait for the output transaction to be confirmed.
    await tx.out.wait();
});
```

:::caution Note

This example shows the basic code for handling a gateway transaction, but doesn't deal with any error handling or retrying.
