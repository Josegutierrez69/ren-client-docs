import { DocTag, DocType } from "/components/DocTag";

<DocTag type={DocType.Tutorial} />

The rest of the tutorial will go through making a React front-end with RenJS that interacts with the contract from part 1.

### Install dependencies

Use create-react-app to set-up a basic React site:

```shell
yarn create react-app tutorial-ui --template typescript
cd ./tutorial-ui
```

Install some additional dependencies which will be used through out the rest of the tutorial:

```
yarn add @renproject/ren@next @renproject/chains@next @renproject/utils@next
yarn add @craco/craco
yarn add async-button
```

### Craco config

Webpack, which is used internally by Create React App and React Scripts, no longer provides polyfills for node.js modules. We use [Craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) to re-enable this, because some of the dependencies imported by @renproject/chains require this.

Create `craco.config.js`:

```js reference title="craco.config.js"
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/craco.config.js
```

### Running site

You can now test out the website by running:

```shell
yarn start
```

You should now see it open in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically show up in the browser.
