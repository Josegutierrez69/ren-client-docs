Bringing everything together, we'll now write the App component in `App.tsx`.

### RenJS

Firstly, we'll want to initialize RenJS and the chains that we'll be using.

We'll initialize the Ethereum class with a public JSON-RPC endpoint, but we won't pass it a signer yet, since we do that in CreateGateway.tsx.

Replace the existing code in the App component with the following (`useState`s are used for compactness - replace with `useRef`s if required):

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L11-L25
```

and update the imports:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L1-L8
```

Next, we want to store the list of all Gateway Transactions we've seen so far:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L26-L33
```

When a new gateway is created, we want to store it and listen for new Gateway Transactions:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L35-L43
```

---

The return statement of `App` will now link the gateway and gatewayTxs states with the components we made in the previous sections.

Firstly, `CreateGateway`:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L45-L52
```

And finally, we loop through `gatewayTxs` and show a `GatewayTx` for each transaction:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/App.tsx#L54-L70
```

```tsx reference link title="App.tsx"

```

</details>

That's the last component - you can now run the site in your browser to test it out.

Make sure you have a Web3 wallet installed (such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)), and connect it to the right network (Görli for Ethereum testnet).

You will need testnet BTC and Görli ETH, which can be found here:

-   [Testnet BTC Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co)
-   [Görli ETH Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)
