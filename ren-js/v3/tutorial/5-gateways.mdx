title: 5. Gateways

import { DocTag, DocType } from "/components/DocTag";

<DocTag type={DocType.Tutorial} />

At the top of the hierarchy is the Gateway, which allows users to initiate Gateway Transactions. A Gateway can be one of two types:

1. Deposit gateway - where the user deposits funds to a gateway address
2. Contract gateway - where the user will call a contract which will emit lock or burn events

The CreateGateway component will show a button to create a gateway, and then will show the gateway based on what type it is.

The interface of `CreateGateway.tsx` looks like:

```tsx reference title="CreateGateway.tsx"
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway_0.tsx
```

### `connectWeb3Wallet`

This helper function handles conecting a Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Put this at the top level of `CreateGateway.tsx`:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway.tsx#L14-L26
```

### Component implementation

At the top of the component, we'll define the asset and chains for the gateway. This allows us to use them throughout the rest of the component.

:::note

In this code snippet, we specify **BTC**, **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**, but you can easily modify these to other chains, referring to each chain's documentation for how to update `renJS.gateway({...})`. You'll also need to initialize any other chain in `App.tsx`.

:::

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway.tsx#L37-L39
```

Next, we'll write the callback `createDepositGateway`, which will be called when the user clicks a button to create a gateway. After creating it, the gateway will passed to the `onGateway` callback prop.

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway.tsx#L35-L68
```

The other required callback is `createWithdrawGateway` - this is included in the full `CreateGateway.tsx` below, to give you a chance to try implementing it yourself first, or return to later after completing `CreateGateway.tsx` and `App.tsx`.

Some things to note are that you'll need to set `useRenParams` to false, since `withdraw` doesn't expect the `amount`, `nHash` and `signature` parameters that `deposit` does.

The completed version below makes use of `EVMParam.EVM_TO_ADDRESS` which you can read more about in the [Ethereum docs](`../reference/chains/ethereum.mdx`).

```tsx
const createWithdrawGateway = useCallback(async () => {
    // Implement `withdraw` gateway.
});
```

For the return statement of the component, we'll want to branch on whether the `gateway` prop is defined or not.

If it's defined, then we want to show the gateway, either by showing a gateway address, or by showing a Chain Transaction component:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway.tsx#L124-L133
```

If a gateway hasn't been created yet, then we'll want to show the buttons to create one:

```tsx reference title=""
https://github.com/renproject/ren-js-v3-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-ui/src/CreateGateway.tsx#L134-L139
```
