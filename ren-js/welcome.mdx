Welcome to the RenJS docs. If you are just starting out, start by jumping into the RenJS v3 docs in the sidebar: [RenJS v3 Docs](./v3/quick-start).

### Why a new major version?

As RenVM has evolved to support more features, RenJS has been adapted to provide developers with an easier and more natural framework to integrate with RenVM.

RenJS v3 is the latest iteration of the library, with a similar and yet more flexible interface compared to previous versions. This current interface is now considered to be stable, and any future features and improvements will be built on top of the current interface with the goal of minimizing any breaking interface changes.

RenJS v2 will continue to receive any required security updates until integrators have had a chance to migrate to RenJS v3.
