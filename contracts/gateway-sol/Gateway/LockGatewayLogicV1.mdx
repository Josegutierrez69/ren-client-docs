## Contract: `LockGatewayLogicV1`

Gateway handles verifying mint and burn requests. A mintAuthority
approves new assets to be minted by providing a digital signature. An owner
of an asset can request for it to be burnt.



Inherits from:

- `LockGatewayStateV1`
- `CanReclaimTokens`
- `Claimable`
- `Ownable`
- `Context`
- `Initializable`

## Functions

### **`initialize`** *`(contract RenERC20LogicV1 _token, address _feeRecipient, address _mintAuthority, uint16 _lockFee, uint16 _releaseFee, uint256 _minimumBurnAmount)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_token`: The RenERC20 this Gateway is responsible for.

- `_feeRecipient`: The recipient of burning and minting fees.

- `_mintAuthority`: The address of the key that can sign mint
       requests.

- `_lockFee`: The amount subtracted each mint request and
       forwarded to the feeRecipient. In BIPS.

- `_releaseFee`: The amount subtracted each burn request and
       forwarded to the feeRecipient. In BIPS.






<hr />

### **`claimTokenOwnership`** *`()`* (public)



Claims ownership of the token passed in to the constructor.
`transferStoreOwnership` must have previously been called.
Anyone can call this function.



<hr />

### **`updateMintAuthority`** *`(address _nextMintAuthority)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_nextMintAuthority`: The address to start paying fees to.


Allow the owner to update the fee recipient.





<hr />

### **`updateFeeRecipient`** *`(address _nextFeeRecipient)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_nextFeeRecipient`: The address to start paying fees to.


Allow the owner to update the fee recipient.





<hr />

### **`updateLockFee`** *`(uint16 _nextLockFee)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_nextLockFee`: The new fee for locking.


Allow the owner to update the 'mint' fee.





<hr />

### **`updateReleaseFee`** *`(uint16 _nextReleaseFee)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_nextReleaseFee`: The new fee for releasing.


Allow the owner to update the burn fee.





<hr />

### **`lock`** *`(string _chain, bytes _to, bytes _payload, uint256 _amount) → uint256`* (public)







<hr />

### **`release`** *`(bytes32 _pHash, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _nHash, bytes _sig) → uint256`* (public)

**Params**
- `_pHash`: (payload hash) The hash of the payload associated with the
       release.

- `_amount`: The amount of the token being released, in its smallest
       value. (e.g. satoshis for BTC).

- `_nHash`: (nonce hash) The hash of the nonce, amount and pHash.

- `_sig`: The signature of the hash of the following values:
       (pHash, amount, msg.sender, nHash), signed by the mintAuthority.


release verifies a release approval signature from RenVM and
        sends tokens after taking a fee for the `_feeRecipient`.





<hr />

### **`verifySignature`** *`(bytes32 _signedMessageHash, bytes _sig) → bool`* (public)



verifySignature checks the the provided signature matches the provided
parameters.



<hr />

### **`hashForSignature`** *`(bytes32 _pHash, uint256 _amount, address _to, bytes32 _nHash) → bytes32`* (public)



hashForSignature hashes the parameters so that they can be signed.



<hr />
