## Contract: `Validate`

Validate is a library for validating malicious darknode behaviour.

## Functions

### **`duplicatePropose`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash1, uint256 _validRound1, bytes _signature1, bytes _blockhash2, uint256 _validRound2, bytes _signature2) → address`* (internal)


**Returns**
- `The`: address of the signer if and only if propose messages were
        different.

Recovers two propose messages and checks if they were signed by
        the same darknode. If they were different but the height and
        round were the same, then the darknode was behaving maliciously.




<hr />

### **`recoverPropose`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash, uint256 _validRound, bytes _signature) → address`* (internal)







<hr />

### **`proposeMessage`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash, uint256 _validRound) → bytes`* (internal)







<hr />

### **`duplicatePrevote`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash1, bytes _signature1, bytes _blockhash2, bytes _signature2) → address`* (internal)


**Returns**
- `The`: address of the signer if and only if prevote messages were
        different.

Recovers two prevote messages and checks if they were signed by
        the same darknode. If they were different but the height and
        round were the same, then the darknode was behaving maliciously.

### **`recoverPrevote`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash, bytes _signature) → address`* (internal)







<hr />

### **`prevoteMessage`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash) → bytes`* (internal)







<hr />

### **`duplicatePrecommit`** *`(uint256 _height, uint256 _round, bytes _blockhash1, bytes _signature1, bytes _blockhash2, bytes _signature2) → address`* (internal)


**Returns**
- `The`: address of the signer if and only if precommit messages were
        different.

Recovers two precommit messages and checks if they were signed
        by the same darknode. If they were different but the height and
        round were the same, then the darknode was behaving maliciously.

### **`recoverSecret`** *`(uint256 _a, uint256 _b, uint256 _c, uint256 _d, uint256 _e, uint256 _f, bytes _signature) → address`* (internal)







<hr />

### **`secretMessage`** *`(uint256 _a, uint256 _b, uint256 _c, uint256 _d, uint256 _e, uint256 _f) → bytes`* (internal)
