## Functions

### **`initialize`** *`(string _VERSION, contract RenToken _renAddress, contract DarknodeRegistryStore _storeAddress, uint256 _minimumBond, uint256 _minimumPodSize, uint256 _minimumEpochIntervalSeconds, uint256 _deregistrationIntervalSeconds)`* (public)

**Params**
- `_VERSION`: A string defining the contract version.

- `_renAddress`: The address of the RenToken contract.

- `_storeAddress`: The address of the DarknodeRegistryStore contract.

- `_minimumBond`: The minimum bond amount that can be submitted by a
       Darknode.

- `_minimumPodSize`: The minimum size of a Darknode pod.

- `_minimumEpochIntervalSeconds`: The minimum number of seconds between epochs.


The contract constructor.





<hr />

### **`register`** *`(address _darknodeID, bytes _publicKey)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_darknodeID`: The darknode ID that will be registered.

- `_publicKey`: The public key of the darknode. It is stored to allow
       other darknodes and traders to encrypt messages to the trader.


Register a darknode and transfer the bond to this contract.
Before registering, the bond transfer must be approved in the REN
contract. The caller must provide a public encryption key for the
darknode. The darknode will remain pending registration until the next
epoch. Only after this period can the darknode be deregistered. The
caller of this method will be stored as the owner of the darknode.





<hr />

### **`deregister`** *`(address _darknodeID)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_darknodeID`: The darknode ID that will be deregistered. The caller
       of this method must be the owner of this darknode.


Deregister a darknode. The darknode will not be deregistered
until the end of the epoch. After another epoch, the bond can be
refunded by calling the refund method.




<hr />

### **`epoch`** *`()`* (external)



Progress the epoch if it is possible to do so. This captures
the current timestamp and current blockhash and overrides the current
epoch.



<hr />

### **`transferStoreOwnership`** *`(contract DarknodeRegistryLogicV1 _newOwner)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_newOwner`: The address to transfer the ownership to.


Allows the contract owner to initiate an ownership transfer of
the DarknodeRegistryStore.




<hr />

### **`claimStoreOwnership`** *`()`* (external)



Claims ownership of the store passed in to the constructor.
`transferStoreOwnership` must have previously been called when
transferring from another Darknode Registry.



<hr />

### **`updateDarknodePayment`** *`(contract IDarknodePayment _darknodePayment)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_darknodePayment`: The address of the Darknode Payment
contract.


Allows the contract owner to update the address of the
darknode payment contract.




<hr />

### **`updateMinimumBond`** *`(uint256 _nextMinimumBond)`* (external)

**Params**

       a darknode.


Allows the contract owner to update the minimum bond.




<hr />

### **`updateMinimumPodSize`** *`(uint256 _nextMinimumPodSize)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_nextMinimumPodSize`: The minimum size of a pod.


Allows the contract owner to update the minimum pod size.




<hr />

### **`updateMinimumEpochInterval`** *`(uint256 _nextMinimumEpochInterval)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_nextMinimumEpochInterval`: The minimum number of blocks between epochs.


Allows the contract owner to update the minimum epoch interval.




<hr />

### **`updateSlasher`** *`(contract IDarknodeSlasher _slasher)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_slasher`: The new slasher address.


Allow the contract owner to update the DarknodeSlasher contract
address.




<hr />

### **`slash`** *`(address _guilty, address _challenger, uint256 _percentage)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_guilty`: The guilty prover whose bond is being slashed.

- `_challenger`: The challenger who should receive a portion of the bond as reward.

- `_percentage`: The total percentage  of bond to be slashed.


Allow the DarknodeSlasher contract to slash a portion of darknode's
        bond and deregister it.




<hr />

### **`refund`** *`(address _darknodeID)`* (external)

**Params**
- `_darknodeID`: The darknode ID that will be refunded.


Refund the bond of a deregistered darknode. This will make the
darknode available for registration again. Anyone can call this function
but the bond will always be refunded to the darknode operator.





<hr />

### **`getDarknodeOperator`** *`(address _darknodeID) → address payable`* (external)

**Params**
- `_darknodeID`: The ID of the darknode to retrieve the owner for.


Retrieves the address of the account that registered a darknode.




<hr />

<hr />

### **`getDarknodes`** *`(address _start, uint256 _count) → address[]`* (external)

**Params**
- `_start`: A darknode ID used as an offset for the list. If _start is

       included it is not registered for the epoch.

- `_count`: The number of darknodes to retrieve starting from _start.
       If _count is 0, all of the darknodes from _start are
       retrieved. If _count is more than the remaining number of
       registered darknodes, the rest of the list will contain
       0x0s.


Retrieves a list of darknodes which are registered for the
current epoch.
