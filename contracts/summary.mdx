## Darknode contracts (Ethereum-only)

The darknode contracts include the following contracts:

### `RenToken`

This is the ERC20 contract for the REN token.

### `DarknodeRegistry` and `DarknodeRegistryStore`

These contracts are responsible for managing the registration and bonding of darknodes.

The `DarknodeRegistry` handles the logic of registering, while the `DarknodeRegistryStore` stores the REN used for bonds.

### `DarknodePayment` and `DarknodePaymentStore` [LEGACY]

Minting and burning fees were previously subtracted on Ethereum, and then forwarded to the `DarknodePayment` contract.

Fees are now collected in RenVM instead, but darknode operators can still withdraw legacy rewards from the `DarknodePayment` contract through the Command Center.

### `Protocol`

The `Protocol` contract tracks the addresses of all of the other contracts.

## EVM Gateway contracts

### `RenERC20`

Each ren-asset (e.g. renBTC, renDOGE, etc.) is represented on EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, etc.) by an ERC20 contract.

### `MintGateway`

Each `RenERC20` has an associated `MintGateway` contract which is responsible for minting and burning the ren-asset. It handles verifying the RenVM signature, and emitting burn events which are watched by RenVM.

A future upgrade will unify all `MintGateway`s into a single contract that manages all `RenERC20` contracts.

### `GatewayRegistry`

Each EVM-compatible chain has a `GatewayRegistry` which can be used to look-up the `MintGateway` and `RenERC20` contract addresses from a symbol.

A future upgrade will replace the `GatewayRegistry` with a `RenERC20Factory` which will also be responsible for deploying new `RenERC20`s.

### `BasicAdapter`

The `BasicAdapter` contract is not part of the core RenVM protocol contracts, and is only used by the front-end RenJS library. It's a contract that submits mint signatures to a `MintGateway` and then forwards the minted ren-asset to the specified recipient.
