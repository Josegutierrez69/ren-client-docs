:::tip

For now, integrating with Ren contracts is only documented for EVM chains and Solidity.

:::

The [RenJS Tutorial](/ren-js/tutorial/overview) goes through writing a smart contract that can mint Ren-tokens.

There is also the [Ren Solidity Template](https://github.com/renproject/ren-solidity-template) repository which has a working set-up including local tests using RenJS.

## Solidity

In order for a contract to be compatible with how RenJS submits mints, the function being called must follow the following standard:

```solidity
function functionName(

    // Normal parameters - can be any number and types
    uint256 _param1,
    uint256 _param2,

    // Parameters from RenVM
    uint256        _amount,
    bytes32        _nHash,
    bytes calldata _sig

) external {

  // ... your code

  // Hash parameters. All parameters besides _amount, _nHash and _sig should be included.
  bytes32 pHash = keccak256(abi.encode(_param1, _param2));

  // Mint Ren-asset. The returned value is how much was minted, after subtracting RenVM fees.
  uint256 mintedAmount = registry.getGatewayBySymbol("BTC").mint(pHash, _amount, _nHash, _sig);

  // ... your code

}
```

If you want to support multiple Ren-assets, then you can pass in a `_symbol` parameter anywhere in the parameters (before the `_amount` parameter) and pass it to `getGatewayBySymbol`.

## Testing on a local network
