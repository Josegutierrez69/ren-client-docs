This page documents previous upgrades to the mainnet contracts.

The contracts are governed by a Multisig with a 7-day timelock. Over time, more parties will be added to this Multisig.

## Previous upgrades

### Upgrade 1 - 2020

The minting fees on Ethereum were updated to 25 BPS (0.25%).

### Upgrade 2 - June 11 2021

The BTC, ZEC and BCH gateway contracts on Ethereum were updated to support the RenVM v0.4 upgrade, while remaining backwards compatible with the v0.2 mint signature format.

### Upgrade 3 - June 28 2021

Mint and burn fees were set to 0 for all assets across all networks, so that fees can be collected directly in RenVM.

## Planned upgrades
