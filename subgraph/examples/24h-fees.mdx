The RenVM subgraphs expose historic data by passing in a block parameter to the query.

In order to fetch the network fees for the past 24 hours, you first need to calculate the block number from 24 hours ago.

Here's a quick way to calculate it, if accuracy isn't critical:

```js
// ... set up Web3

const current = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();

// Average block time from https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime
const averageBlockTime = 13;

const dayAgo = current - Math.floor((24 * 60 * 60) / averageBlockTime);
```

The current block can also be fetched from the subgraph with the following query:

```graphql
{
  _meta {
    block {
      number
    }
  }
}
```

After fetching the latest block and calculating the block 24 hours ago, you an fetch the volumes for each block with the following query,
replacing the logs with the calculated amounts.

<GraphQL
  url="https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/renproject/renvm"
  defaultQuery={`{
  current: renVM(id: 1, block: {number: 12137999}) {
    fees {
      symbol
      amountInUsd
    }
  }
  dayAgo: renVM(id: 1, block: {number: 12131352}) {
    fees {
      symbol
      amountInUsd
    }
  }
}`}
/>

<br />

You can then loop each asset to get the difference:

```js
const dayAgo = response.data.dayAgo.fees.reduce(
  (acc, token) => ({ ...acc, [token.symbol]: token }),
  {}
);

response.data.current.fees.reduce(
  (acc, { symbol, amountInUsd }) => ({
    ...acc,
    [symbol]: amountInUsd - dayAgo[symbol].amountInUsd,
  }),
  {}
);
```
