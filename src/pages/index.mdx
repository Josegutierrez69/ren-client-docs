Welcome to the Ren Client Docs. This website contains information for interacting with Ren and RenVM.

It documents to tools that have been used to build the Ren Bridge ([bridge.renproject.io](https://bridge.renproject.io)), the Command Center ([mainnet.renproject.io](https://mainnet.renproject.io)) and other tools and sites.

Start by chosing one of the main categories:

- [**RenJS**](/ren-js) - an SDK for integrating with RenVM to mint and burn ren-assets
- [**Contracts**](/contracts) - for learning about RenVM's on-chain smart contracts
  - [**Contract deployments**](/contracts/deployments) - the deployed contract addresses
- [**Subgraph**](/subgraph) - for querying stats of RenVM's on-chain usage/activity
- [**JSON-RPC**](/api) - for interacting directly with RenVM's nodes

More links:

- [Command Center](https://mainnet.renproject.io) - for RenVM stats and for managing darknode
- [Bridge](https://bridge.renproject.io) - the official interface for minting and burning ren-assets
- [Dev Tools v0.2](https://renproject.github.io/dev-tools) - for looking up RenVM hashes for BTC/ZEC/BCH minting on ETH
- [Dev Tools v0.3](https://renproject.github.io/dev-tools-v0.3/) (in development) - for looking up RenVM hashes for all other asset/chain combinations
